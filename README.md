# codewhisper

codewhisper is an innovative VS Code extension that serves as an AI-powered pair programmer, using voice control and artificial intelligence to assist developers in real-time.

## Project Overview

codewhisper revolutionizes the coding experience by allowing developers to interact with their entire codebase using voice commands. It leverages advanced AI to understand context, make intelligent edits, and provide real-time feedback, all driven by natural speech input.

## Key Features

- **Voice-Controlled Coding**: Navigate and manipulate your code using natural speech commands.
- **AI-Driven Code Edits**: Watch as the AI makes intelligent code changes based on your voice instructions.
- **Real-time Feedback**: See the AI's thought process and actions as they happen, providing instant visual feedback.
- **Whole Codebase Understanding**: codewhisper analyzes your entire project, offering context-aware suggestions and edits.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core language for speech processing and AI integration
- **Deepgram**: Advanced speech-to-text conversion for accurate voice command interpretation
- **OpenAI**: Powerful language model for code understanding and generation
- **VS Code Extension API**: Integration with Visual Studio Code for seamless user experience
- **TypeScript**: Used for developing the VS Code extension
- **Node.js**: Runtime environment for the extension

## Future Enhancements

- Implement more advanced code refactoring capabilities
- Add support for multiple programming languages and frameworks
- Integrate with version control systems for smarter collaborative coding
- Develop a context-aware code suggestion system based on the user's coding patterns
